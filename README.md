----

A joke-telling Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display. Project 4 of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree.

The app contains
* A Java library that supplies jokes. 
* A Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) project that serves those jokes.
* An Android Library containing an activity for displaying jokes.
* Paid and free flavors. The paid flavor has no ads, and no unnecessary dependencies.
* A free app variant displays an ad on the main activity.
* A loading indicator while the joke is being fetched from the server.
